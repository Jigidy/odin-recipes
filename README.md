Odin Recipes Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate some choppity chops in HTML. Its not going to be pretty right now, but that is a ok. This README file also will serve as 
something of a reflective document as I complete the project. 

Lets get this party started. 

Entry 1
- The website is coming along. I should have at least the second recipe done by the end of the session for today. I have decided I want the website to have a funny tone, so I want to start building around that. The tone should be irreverent and comedically insulting. 
    - This being the case, some aspects of perogiesanonion.html still need to be updated further to match that tone. Right now I'm just getting the ingredients and recipe down, and I'll probably sort out the html doc for the third recipe before finalizing humour and tone.
    - This is also just a basic html project so don't get to hung up on it bucko. 

- I want to see if I can centre the text. It might not be an HTML thing but I want to try and figure it out anyways.
