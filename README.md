Odin Recipes Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate some choppity chops in HTML. Its not going to be pretty right now, but that is a ok. This README file also will serve as 
something of a reflective document as I complete the project. 

Lets get this party started. 

Entry 1
- The website is coming along. I should have at least the second recipe done by the end of the session for today. I have decided I want the website to have a funny tone, so I want to start building around that. The tone should be irreverent and comedically insulting. 
    - This being the case, some aspects of perogiesanonion.html still need to be updated further to match that tone. Right now I'm just getting the ingredients and recipe down, and I'll probably sort out the html doc for the third recipe before finalizing humour and tone.
    - This is also just a basic html project so don't get to hung up on it bucko. 

- I want to see if I can centre the text. It might not be an HTML thing but I want to try and figure it out anyways. 

Entry 2

- Getting further along in the project. I'm pretty sure I could just hand it in as it is now, but I want to try and improve it in a few ways. 
1. First, I still want to see if I can centre some of the text with HTML. Hell, I'll even do a little bit of CSS at this point if it is not too crazy too put it off.
2. Can we tab paragraphs? We need to try and tab paragraphs. I'm sure its really simple, might even just be hitting tab in the element. 
3. Can we change the text colour and the background colour to white and dark, respectively? Darkmode is better
4. Adding links to each page that leads back to the index.html page, as well as to the top of the page. 
5. Editing, essentially. We just need to now check through and make sure everything is spelled right and we really improve on the irreverent and comedic tonnes. 

Entry 3 (Final Entry Probably)

- We basically have to edit stuff and make more links. 
- I have added a little bit of inline CSS to make the paragraphs tab, because I wanted them to. Untabbed paragraphs are the worst, so they need to tab.
- Darkmode? I have not explored this, and I'm feeling that I may not get to it. Feels like a CSS thing, which I'll probably learn more about later. 
- Links being added will be quick and easy. 

Then after all of this we just have to publish it to the internet!

Final, Final Entry

- So we've added most of the CSS we've wanted to add. Its been an uphill trek mostly due to life not the code itself, but we're almost there. There are two things left I'm trying to accomplish. 
1. I want to make each of the images look perf. I think perhaps a couple ID selectors may be best for this, but I'll need to double check.
2. I want to make the background a gradient of color. It is a challenge I've put to myself to push myself a bit more forward.

The first one should be easy, the second one may not be as simple. 

Last update: As it turns out, making a gradient is a little more complex then just writing a bit of CSS, so I think it may be better just to let it be for now and learn how to do it in a latter lesson. So we're going to just call this done and move forward.
