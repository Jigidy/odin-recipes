            <p>You ever wanted the tastied pierogies you have ever had without needing to also slaughter animals for them. Well your in luck, because ol' Jigidy knows how to do it. The wise man mostly makes his pierogies without meat and may I say they are some of the best pierogies you are going to find. They're also cheap, for all you starving students out there.</p>

            <p><strong>Here is how you make them!</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>1 dozen pierogies</li>
                <li>2 Beyond Meat Sausages</li>
                <li>Paprika, Cumin and Salt</li>
                <li>1 Whole Onion</li>
                <li><strong>Optional: Garlic Clove or two</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                
            </ol>
